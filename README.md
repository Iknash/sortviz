# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Description

This is a C program designed to visualize various sorting algorithms in real-time. The program uses ASCII characters to represent values in an array, providing a graphical representation as the array gets sorted. You can select the size of the array, the sorting speed, and the specific sorting algorithm you'd like to visualize.

## Features

- Support for multiple sorting algorithms
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Bogo Sort
  - Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Adjustable array size based on terminal rows
- Variable sorting speed
- Dynamic terminal clearing for real-time visualization
